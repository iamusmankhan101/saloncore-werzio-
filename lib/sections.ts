 * record must never become unreachable just because someone switched the
 * dashboard into Men's or Women's.

 * Every listing used to test `record.section === activeSection` outright, which
 * hid untagged records from all three views at once: they were only visible
 * under "All Sections". That is what "the services I added disappeared after a
 * few days" actually was — the records were safe in Turso the whole time (the
 * stored count only ever grew), but the salon flipped the section switcher and
 * every service with a blank Section vanished from the catalogue, the POS, and
 * the booking screens. Services get a blank section easily: the Add form's
 * Salon Section picker defaults to "Unassigned", and an imported spreadsheet
 * with no Section column leaves all of them blank.
