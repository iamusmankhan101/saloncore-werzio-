// ─── Cross-device record reconciliation ───────────────────────────────────────
// Every entity in this app is stored as one JSON array per user/branch: in each
// browser's localStorage, and as a single row in Turso. That made "save" a
// whole-array write, so two PCs signed into the same salon quietly clobbered
// each other — whichever pushed last won, and any record the other machine had
// added since its own last sync vanished from the shared DB. That is how the
// same Cash Flow date range could show a different income total on each PC.
//
// Three rules make the two copies converge instead:
//
//   1. Absence is not a delete. POST /api/db unions the incoming array with
//      what is already stored; a record only disappears once it is tombstoned
//      (lib/deleted-records.ts).
//   2. Every real delete leaves a tombstone. reconcileSave() diffs the list
//      being saved against the one already in localStorage and reports whatever
//      the caller dropped, so no delete path has to remember to do it by hand.
//   3. Edits carry a timestamp. reconcileSave() stamps `_updatedAt` on records
//      whose content actually changed, and both merge points (syncFromDB here
//      and the POST handler on the server) keep the newer side instead of
//      always preferring whatever the local machine happens to hold.
//
// The stamp is deliberately named with a leading underscore: it is sync
// bookkeeping, not part of any entity's own schema (lib/attendance.ts already
// has its own `updatedAt` field, which this must not collide with).
