       The A4 sheet hangs the logo to the right of the salon name at 90px tall.
       On a 72mm roll that is most of the column, and beside the name rather
       than above it, so the receipt header is rebuilt here: the block centres
       and reverses (the logo is the second child in the DOM, so column-reverse
       lifts it above the name without touching the A4 markup).
       Capped in mm because what matters is how much paper it costs — 18mm of
       an 80mm roll, before a single line of the sale.
       The filter binarises the mark to solid black, because the head has one
       dot value and no grey: anything in between is dithered into a speckle,
       which is what made the logo print washed out. CSS has no threshold
       filter, so this builds one — brightness(0.5543) scales the cut point onto
       contrast's pivot (0.5 / 0.5543 = 0.902 = 230/255) and contrast(10000%)
       then drives everything below it to black and everything above it to
       white, with a transition band about two levels wide. 230 is the same
       BLACK_THRESHOLD the ESC/POS path uses (lib/escpos-raster.ts), so the two
       thermal paths render the same logo identically — change one and change
       the other. The cut sits near white because salon logos are fine line art
       in light brand tones: at a 170 cut, a thin gold ring and the lettering
       inside it fell above the threshold and printed as a broken circle around
       an empty middle. */
