/**
 * /api/whatsapp/queue-delete
 *
 * Removes a single row from one of the two WhatsApp send queues, so a message
 * that should never go out (wrong number, cancelled appointment, a receipt for
 * a sale that was rung up twice) can be pulled before the drain cron picks it
 * up — and so the "recently processed" list can be tidied afterwards.
 *
 * Deleting a queue row is NOT the same as un-sending: nothing here touches
 * wa_message_logs, which is what requeue-failed and the drain cron consult to
 * decide whether a client has already received something. Clearing a 'sent'
 * row therefore only clears the display, and can never cause a second copy of
 * the same message to be delivered.
 *
 * The two queues are keyed differently — wa_booking_send_queue by its own row
 * id, wa_pos_receipt_queue by invoice_id (see the PRIMARY KEYs in
 * queue-status/route.ts) — which is why the caller has to say which queue the
 * row came from. queue-details/route.ts already reports that as `source`.
